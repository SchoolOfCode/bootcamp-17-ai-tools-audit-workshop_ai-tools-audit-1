**Techforge** needs your expertise to identify AI tools that can benefit the company. This is where you'll compile and share your full audit report, collaborating as a team to deliver insights that will shape Techforge's future!

## 📋 Here's What to Do:

1. **Create a new markdown file** for each AI tool that you evaluate. We suggest possibly using any of the areas of evaluation mentioned in the task brief.
      - Opportunity
      - Risk
      - Tangible Benefit
      - Evaluation
2. After you've completed all of the audits, you will **Compile The Report** in this file. Delete everything here, and then write your:
      - Executive Summary
      - Introduction
      - Conclusion and Recommendations
3. Discuss and **choose AI tools** as a team, and evaluate them across whichever key areas you feel is best suited.
4. **Collaborate** as a team to ensure your findings are thorough and cover all necessary aspects.
5. Once you're satisfied with your findings, **'Commit changes'** to the main branch of the repository.
6. Your team members can then **present your findings** individually or as a team based on the markdown reports.
